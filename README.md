# DiamondPachinko
A project I wanted to share with people who want to know how I created this game as part of the Unity Learn Course (Challenge: Sprite pachinko). 
Hammered this out in about 4-5 hours, so not the best scripting techniques implemented. 
Wanted to keep it simple and unique.

Feel free to modify and test out your own stuff with this project. Share your High Score with me!
